### 2. Centralized Language Resources

All language-specific files and resources are centralized within `KF_Localization`, making it a one-stop repository for managing and updating localization content. This approach enhances maintainability and reduces redundancy across the application's codebase.

### 3. Submodule Integration

Being a submodule, `KF_Localization` seamlessly integrates into both KeysFortress Mobile and KeysFortress Desktop repositories. This integration facilitates the sharing of language resources across platforms, ensuring uniformity in the user experience.

### 4. Testing and Validation:

As part of your testing process, validate the localization by switching between languages to ensure a smooth transition and accurate representation of content.
